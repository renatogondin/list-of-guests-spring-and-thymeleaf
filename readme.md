<h2>Guest list for a party</h2>

<p>You can add a new guest (“convidado” in portuguese), and each guest can bring companions (“acompanhantes”). </br> 
  But, only those with credentials are able to access the list (Spring Security helped). </br>
  I previously deployed to my Heroku’s account, but I took away cause there was no need of deploying </br>
  such a small project.
